        <h1>Weapons</h1>
        <p>In the game, there is a large arsenal of weapons to choose from. Most of the valkryia in the game are only capable of using
            one weapon type. Each one has a basic version of the weapon class once acquired. However, many epic weapons will appear
            later on granting better perks to the valkyria. Down below is a small amount of information about
            some weapons. After the description of the weapon, there will be a ranking of 1-star being common, 2-star and 3-star being uncommon, and
            4-star being epic.
