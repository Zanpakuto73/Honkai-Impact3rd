        <h1>Enemy Types</h1>
        <p>In Honkai impact 3rd, each mission will have multitudes of enemies, each 
            having ties to a force called Honkai which seeks to protect Earth from its inhabitants
            aka the Human race. In the game there are 3 factions. They are creature, mecha, and psychic. The game uses a 
            rock-paper-scissor system for combat. Creature beats psycic, mecha beats creature, and 
            psychic beats mecha. Valkryies will also have similar types as the enemies. Depending on what type
            a valkryie is will determine if they have an advantage, disadvantage, or remain equal to an enemy.

            <td>Honkai usually appears as honkai energy, quite similar to radiation. In the past years,
                it has been able to create storms and plagues such as the Black Death. Now if humans are exposed
                to this radiation too long, they will get infected and morph into zombies. Some include but are not
                limited to:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Vigiles- one of the basic zombies. The honkai radiation has generated scythes for them.</li>
                    <li>Ranger- simeilar to vigiles except they are granted Bows to fire off arrows toward others.</li>
                    <li>Jun-ninja- Wields two swords and skilled at melee combat. Able to dodge most ranged attacks. </li>
                </ul>

            <td>Unlike the other two groups, mechas belong to an organzation known as Anti-Entropy. This group found
                technology in a ruin from the last civilization era. This technology could greatly increase the effeincy of 
                machines using honkai energy. With this in mind, Anti-Entropy prefer using robots rather than humans.
                Some of these mechs include but not limited to:<br>
                <ul>
                    <li>Sunderer- Get to close to this machine and it will stomp you out. Get too far and it will shoot projectiles at you. Sometimes
                        shoots heat sinking missiles as it get attacked more.
                    </li>
                    <li>RPC-6626- A highly dangerous drone. Able to hover and fly out of attacks. It is able to shoot lasers, bullets, and stun missiles.</li>
                    <li>Defense Structure- Enemy unit with the capabilities to shoot from afar and rain energy down from the sky. However, it is very weak.</li>
                </ul>

            <td>Just as Honkai energy transforms humans, the same can be done to animals. That result is honkai beasts.
                 No intelligience has been shown from honkai. However, when there is a burst of honkai energy that is focused on 
                 one individual having the capacity of storing it, a Herscherr. As stated above, Honkai beasts are similar to that of 
                 anti-bodies in a human. They are used when the Earth feels threatened. In this case, humans are the cause.
                 Some of these beasts include but not limited to:<br>
                 <ul>
                     <li>Archangel- Thsi beast will charge at opponents dealing damage or do spin attacks in the air.</li>
                     <li>Alloy Chariot- As big as a bear, these things are known for dealing tons of damage and can 
                         launch soundwaves at Valkyrja.
                     </li>
                     <li>Ganesha- A giant in size, this creature can create shockwaves in a small radius, shoot energy blasts from its mouth,
                         and will roll over its opponents.
                     </li>
                 </ul>
