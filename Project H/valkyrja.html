        <h1 id="head">Valkyria</h1>
        <p id="h">Valkryja are disposable soldiers with stigmata implanted in them and have the ability to transform collapsed energy into battle.
            Most Valkyrja are forced to use man made stigmata because they do not have a natural resistance to Honkai energy at birth. In the game, 
            there are a few valkryia that are playable. Below are just a few.
